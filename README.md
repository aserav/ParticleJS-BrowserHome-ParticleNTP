How to Install

Firefox:
Just choose the ZIP → about:addons → Install Add-on From File.

Chrome / Edge / Brave / Opera:
ZIP won’t work.
Extract the ZIP → go to chrome://extensions/ → turn on Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select the folder.

CRX file:
Chrome might accept it if you drag the .crx into chrome://extensions,
but most Chrome versions block unsigned CRX files.
If it fails, just use Load unpacked instead.

⚠️ Important Note

If you see a bar/footer at the bottom of Chrome or another browser on the New Tab page:
Right-click it → choose “Hide footer on New Tab page” (or similar).
